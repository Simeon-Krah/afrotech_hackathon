# afrotech_hackathon
This repository was created to submit codes for the AfroTech AI Hackathon. The hackathon's objective was to encourage people to use generative AI for social good, so I created a RAG-based chatbot for Mpox (a disease of high concern at the time). 
My goal was to offer an interactive platform for sourcing instant and accurate information about the disease, ensuring public health education and assisting in early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the Mpox disease.
